# üß† Brain-Body-Weight-Regressor

Regression analysis to predict animal body weight based on brain weight. This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model and demonstrates the critical need for **feature scaling** in distance-based algorithms.

---

## ‚ú® ML Details

* **Simple Regression:** Predicts Body Weight based on Brain Weight.
* **Data Handling:** Reads and processes data from a structured text file (`animals_weight.txt`).
* **Feature Scaling:** Mandatory use of **StandardScaler** to correctly process the widely varying weights.
* **K-Sensitivity Analysis:** Compares prediction results using different neighbor values (K=1, 3, 5) to understand model robustness.
